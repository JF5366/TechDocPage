  <p>There is a lot that goes in to dairy cattle competitions, much more than meets the eye. The first step is to select a breed.

    <li>Ayrshire</li>
    <li>Milking Shorthorn</li>
    </ul>

  <ul>
     <li>Spring, Winter and Fall Heifer Calves</li>
     <li>Summer,Spring, Winter and Fall Yearling Heifer</li>
     <li>Yearling Heifer in Milk</li>
     <li>Summer Junior Two-Year-Old Cow</li>

   <p>When you pick your first now, you should be looking for the same criteria that the judge will be looking for in the ring, but more on that later.</p>
   <p>After you shop around for cattle and start to build a high-yield genetic herd, you will need to select the best sires to breed with your heifers. You should look for sires with the desirable traits that your animals may be lacking. </p>

   <header>At Home Preparation</header>
   <p>Preparing cattle to win a competition begins long before you step in the ring. You want to provide the best possible veterinary care, housing and food quality to optimize your cattle's potential.</p>
   <p>It is also very important to work with your cattle from a young age so that they are comfortable around people and walking on a lead. You should walk them regularly for short periods of time, preacticing the same movements you will perform in the ring, including walking, stopping, stepping backwards, and standing in a</p>

   <p>Traveling to and staying at competition locations can be very complicated and costly. Many farmers stay in RVs at the fairgrounds, others stay in nearby hotels. If the show is a long distance from home, it is best to coordinate with local dairy farms to send your coes together to cut down on costs.</p>
   <p>You will need to keep your cattle clean for the duration of the fair, so it is important to wash your cattle daily. You will also need to clip their long winter coat, leaving fur on the topline. Before the show you need to use a blow dryer to get the topline hair to stand up in a perfect line. Hair stray can keep the topline in place, and help to fluff the tail.</p>
    <p>Don't forget your show whites!</p>
